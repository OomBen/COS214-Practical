# COS214 Project - The 6 Musketeers

## About
This is a COS214 group project which simulates the hypothetical construction, testing and launching of space hardware for SpaceX.

## Code Source
The code base is contained in a compressed file called <filename>.zip. It contains a 'main.cpp', 'makefile' and all the necessary (.h and .cpp) source files for the program to compile and run.

## Compile and Run
##### 1: Extract the contents of the <filename>.zip file.
##### 2: Open the command prompt (Windows) or terminal (Linux) and navigate to the directory of the extracted content.
##### 3: Type the command "make run" and the program should compile and prompt you for input.

## Program Guide
You will first be prompted to specify the rocket type (i.e Falcon 9 [option 1] and Falcon Heavy [option 2]). This will show which is being constructed.

....continue with this once the program is more completed
